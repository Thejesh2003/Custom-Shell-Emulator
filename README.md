Developed a custom Unix-like shell in C that replicates core features of Bash, including support for both internal and external command execution, process management, and signal handling. The shell leverages key Linux system calls such as fork(), execvp(), waitpid(), getpid(), open(), and read() to create and manage child processes and handle command execution. It includes built-in commands like cd, pwd, echo, jobs, fg, and bg, and supports external commands such as ls, mkdir, sleep, and vi, with optional pipe (|) support. A custom job control system was implemented using linked lists to track process states (Running, Stopped), along with comprehensive signal handling for SIGINT, SIGTSTP, and SIGCHLD to manage user interrupts and background jobs. Additionally, the shell features dynamic prompt customization through PS1-like variables to simulate a real shell environment.
